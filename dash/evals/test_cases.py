"""
Test cases for evaluating Dash.

Each test case includes:
- question: The natural language question to ask
- expected_strings: Strings that should appear in the response (for backward compatibility)
- category: Test category for filtering
- golden_sql: Optional SQL query that produces the expected result

When golden_sql is provided, the evaluation will:
1. Execute the golden SQL to get expected results
2. Compare against actual query results from the agent's response
